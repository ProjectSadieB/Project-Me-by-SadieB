# Project-Me-by-SadieB

Project Me (by me, Sadie B.) is to document my learning process with code that is my own repository to manipulate. First, I follow the tutorial using my instructional repository, then after the Finish step, usually listed under "What's next?" heading, it suggests to create your own or practice on you're own.

I may be in over my head, I do know some light HTML and CSS coding, but I mean light! I enjoy learning and conceptualizing and formulating ideas, but rarely have the tech or know-how for the tools I am wanting, so why not learn and make them for myself possibly?

Wish me luck! Check back and see my progress! Join me! Follow along with me! Any? All? Let me know if you do, too, I could use some friends!
